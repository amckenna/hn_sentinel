# HN Sentinel

This is a flask site that uses new.ycombinator.com's API to track the top 30 posts of the day. The main goal of the site is simply to track the popular stories of the day/week/month/year.

This site is live at https://hn.test.tube

Note: On the live site the API is queried every hour so the vote counts may be off slightly from actuals.
