HN Sentinel
===========

This is a flask site that uses new.ycombinator.com's API to track the top 30 posts of the day.
The main goal of the site is simply to keep track of each day's popular stories.
Eventually you will be able to sort by top for the week, month, and year.
The API is queried every hour so the vote counts may be off slightly from actuals.
